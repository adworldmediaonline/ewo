        <p className="">
          At East West Offroad Products LLC, we didn't start this company
          because it was easy — we started it because it was necessary.
        </p>

        <p className="">
          As off-roading enthusiasts ourselves, we were tired of seeing
          overpriced steering and suspension parts that didn't always deliver on
          quality.
        </p>

        <p className="">
          We knew there had to be a better way — so in 2015, we set out to
          create it.
        </p>

            <h2 className="">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="">
              What began as a personal mission to build better rigs has grown
              into a trusted brand known for high-performance, American-made
              steering and suspension components.
            </p>
            <p className="">We believe in doing things the right way:</p>
            <ul className="">
              <li className="">
                Using premium-grade materials sourced from America.
              </li>
              <li className="">
                Engineering parts that can handle real-world abuse on rocks,
                mud, and trails.
              </li>
              <li className="">
                Offering honest pricing so you can spend less on parts and more
                on your adventures.
              </li>
            </ul>
